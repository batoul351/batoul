Welcome to my restaurant app — a full-featured mobile interface connected to a Laravel backend. Built with **GetX**, **Dio**, and **GetStorage**, this project delivers a smooth and responsive user experience with modern architecture and clean design.

## 🧱 Project Structure

Refactored project folder structure for better scalability and maintainability.  
Replaced the flat structure with a layered architecture:

- **Controller** – Manages logic and state.  
- **Service** – Handles API communication.  
- **Model** – Defines data structures.  
- **View** – Contains UI screens.
